## Nexon'd Trainer Versions Directory

### What are these two files?
This is the versions directory for Nexon'd Trainer.

Nexon'd Trainer will connect to GitHub and retrieve the version numbers located in "Latest Release" and "Supported Release" files.

***Latest Release*** is the current build version of the latest released trainer executable.

***Supported Release*** is the minimum build version that is supported.

### What happens when my release's version is less than that of the number in Supported Release?
Simple. Nexon'd Trainer will automatically prevent you from using the trainer past the initialization stage.

But... why?

Because Nexon'd Trainer is *universal*, supports scripts from any version, and has customizations beyond the up-to-date MapleStory game version, a control is kept as standard development release measures. Most likely if you are running an unsupported build, there's already way better updates to the trainer. Another reason is, if Nexon'd Trainer discontinues development, the continued use of the trainer is not allowed.

### What happens if the trainer cannot connect to GitHub?
Nexon'd Trainer will fail to load past the initialization stage.
