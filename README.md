# Nexon'd Trainer
A Global MapleStory Trainer

This trainer is currently in pre-Alpha development stage. The goal of this trainer is to provide a highly user-customizable and user-friendly experience. This trainer will be heavily based off of [Simple Trainer](https://github.com/md35-gk/Simple-Trainer).

## Planned Features
Nexon'd Trainer should have the following implemented before it's official release to the public:
* Basic hacks, a profile system, ID search tool
* Backwards compatibility through the use of a GitHub-powered Script Bank
  * The trainer will allow users to enter their own custom GitHub Script Bank if they so choose
  * Due to this, the trainer may no longer be able to provide auto ban warnings to certain hacks. Determining a workaround
  * With this being on GitHub, anyone can submit script updates as needed -- ultimately creating the first(?) community-updated trainer. (Those with high knowledge in updating scripts can request to become a Contributor, in which they may merge pull requests and update scripts directly)
* A Log file will be implemented to detail occurring trainer events
* An in-trainer settings tab will be provided to allow users to directly edit trainer details, such as the Script Bank URL

## Expected Release
This trainer, as successor to Simple Trainer, will take much more work and an Open Beta use is expected to begin late March.

## Current Progress
As of 2/2/18, trainer settings has been implemented and the implementation of GitHub retreival and script checks are being worked on.
